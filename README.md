# 🛡️ Ultimate Psionic AngelNET System — Encrypted Weapon Deployment

## Overview

This repository contains the `angelnet_weapon_angel_encrypted.py` module — a highly secure, indestructible psionic-class weapon unit known as **Angel**, integrated with:

- ✅ **AngelNET S5 Role Verification**
- 🧠 **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Authentication**
- 🛡️ **Quantum Anti-Encryption Detection & Neutralization (QAE)**
- 🔐 **Encrypted Interfacing using ECDH + AES-GCM (SecureChannel)**
- 🧬 **Immutable, AI-Assisted Psionic Control System**

The system is designed for deployment in psionic warfare simulation environments, security verification models, and authorized AngelNET command protocols only.

## 🔐 Security Architecture

| Layer                     | Technology                      | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Identity Verification    | `ANGELNET_USER`, `ANGELNET_ROLE`, `ANGELNET_QKEY` | Ensures only authorized S5 personnel can access. |
| BCI Authentication       | `get_bci_auth_signature()`, `check_psionic_resistance()` | Verifies operator has psionic resistance and authorized neural signature. |
| Encrypted Interface      | `ECDH` + `AES-GCM` via `cryptography` | Peer-to-peer handshake and encrypted session. |
| Quantum Defense          | Entropy pattern detection + `neutralize_packet()` | Detects tampered or anomalous post-quantum intrusion attempts. |
| Immutable Weapon Core    | `@dataclass(frozen=True)`       | Ensures the weapon logic can't be altered at runtime. |
| Logging & Audit Trail    | Encrypted logs (audit entries encoded at rest) | All access attempts and anomalies are stored securely. |
